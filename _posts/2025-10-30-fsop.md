## File Stream

## File structure
The file structure is a important component of that standard I/O library in C, representing a file stream. 
`_IO_FILE`
```c
/* The tag name of this struct is _IO_FILE to preserve historic
   C++ mangled names for functions taking FILE* arguments.
   That name should not be used in new code.  */
struct _IO_FILE
{
  int _flags;		/* High-order word is _IO_MAGIC; rest is flags. */

  /* The following pointers correspond to the C++ streambuf protocol. */
  char *_IO_read_ptr;	/* Current read pointer */
  char *_IO_read_end;	/* End of get area. */
  char *_IO_read_base;	/* Start of putback+get area. */
  char *_IO_write_base;	/* Start of put area. */
  char *_IO_write_ptr;	/* Current put pointer. */
  char *_IO_write_end;	/* End of put area. */
  char *_IO_buf_base;	/* Start of reserve area. */
  char *_IO_buf_end;	/* End of reserve area. */

  /* The following fields are used to support backing up and undo. */
  char *_IO_save_base; /* Pointer to start of non-current get area. */
  char *_IO_backup_base;  /* Pointer to first valid character of backup area */
  char *_IO_save_end; /* Pointer to end of non-current get area. */

  struct _IO_marker *_markers;

  struct _IO_FILE *_chain;

  int _fileno;
  int _flags2;
  __off_t _old_offset; /* This used to be _offset but it's too small.  */

  /* 1+column number of pbase(); 0 is unknown. */
  unsigned short _cur_column;
  signed char _vtable_offset;
  char _shortbuf[1];

  _IO_lock_t *_lock;
#ifdef _IO_USE_OLD_IO_FILE
};

struct _IO_FILE_complete
{
  struct _IO_FILE _file;
#endif
  __off64_t _offset;
  /* Wide character stream stuff.  */
  struct _IO_codecvt *_codecvt;
  struct _IO_wide_data *_wide_data;
  struct _IO_FILE *_freeres_list;
  void *_freeres_buf;
  size_t __pad5;
  int _mode;
  /* Make sure we don't get into trouble again.  */
  char _unused2[15 * sizeof (int) - 4 * sizeof (void *) - sizeof (size_t)];
};

```

`_flags` is used to record the attribute of File stream such as read only, write, append and so on. It also shows the status of the file buffering status.

Stream buffer pointer is divided into three parts:
1. read buffer.
	- (`_IO_read_ptr`, `_IO_read_end`, `_IO_read_base`)
2. write buffer.
	- (`_IO_write_ptr`, `_IO_write_end,` `_IO_write_base`)
3. reserve buffer.
	- (`_IO_buf_base`, `_IO_buf_end`)

Where the pointers point to:
- `**ptr` points at the current buffer position.
- `**base` points to the beginning of the buffer.
- `**end` points to the end of the buffer.

`_fileno` is a file descriptor from the file which you open, it returns from the system call `open`. 

Then there is `_IO_FILE_plus` which is an extension of the FILE structure. It adds the virtual function table also called `vtable` (array of pointers to the helper functions during executing the IO operation.)
`_IO_FILE_plus`
```c
/* We always allocate an extra word following an _IO_FILE.
   This contains a pointer to the function jump table used.
   This is for compatibility with C++ streambuf; the word can
   be used to smash to a pointer to a virtual function table. */

struct _IO_FILE_plus
{
  FILE file;
  const struct _IO_jump_t *vtable;
};

```

Default file streams (`stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`) use this extended version.

The purpose of using the extended version `_IO_FILE_plus` is to make IO operations faster by having the `vtable`. The data type for the `vtable` is `_IO_jump_t` which stores the pointer to the needed IO helper methods.

`_IO_jump_t`
```c
struct _IO_jump_t
{
    JUMP_FIELD(size_t, __dummy);
    JUMP_FIELD(size_t, __dummy2);
    JUMP_FIELD(_IO_finish_t, __finish);
    JUMP_FIELD(_IO_overflow_t, __overflow);
    JUMP_FIELD(_IO_underflow_t, __underflow);
    JUMP_FIELD(_IO_underflow_t, __uflow);
    JUMP_FIELD(_IO_pbackfail_t, __pbackfail);
    /* showmany */
    JUMP_FIELD(_IO_xsputn_t, __xsputn);
    JUMP_FIELD(_IO_xsgetn_t, __xsgetn);
    JUMP_FIELD(_IO_seekoff_t, __seekoff);
    JUMP_FIELD(_IO_seekpos_t, __seekpos);
    JUMP_FIELD(_IO_setbuf_t, __setbuf);
    JUMP_FIELD(_IO_sync_t, __sync);
    JUMP_FIELD(_IO_doallocate_t, __doallocate);
    JUMP_FIELD(_IO_read_t, __read);
    JUMP_FIELD(_IO_write_t, __write);
    JUMP_FIELD(_IO_seek_t, __seek);
    JUMP_FIELD(_IO_close_t, __close);
    JUMP_FIELD(_IO_stat_t, __stat);
    JUMP_FIELD(_IO_showmanyc_t, __showmanyc);
    JUMP_FIELD(_IO_imbue_t, __imbue);
};
```


Very FILE structure is associated with a linked list and the head of the linked list is called `_IO_list_all` and the next pointer is called `_chain`
