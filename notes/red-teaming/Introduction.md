# What is Red Teaming?

Red teaming is a process for testing the overall cybersecurity of organizations where a team of ethical hackers (security professionals) carry out a simulated  and nondestructive cyberattack. The simulated cyberattack helps organizations identify vulnerabilities in its system and make improvements to security operations. 

The goals of a Red Team attack are to understand how a real threat actor would act when attempting to gain access to a network and to analyze the attack surface to learn and identify the vulnerabilities so that they can be mitigated. The main goal is to understand security opertaions as a whole (people, processes, technology), and test the organization's detection and response capabilities.

Red Team attacks leverage a particular set of tactics, techniqures, and procedures (TTPs) ti breach a newtork and steal data based on the security of the organization and it's business. 

Red Teaming goes beyond regular [penetration testing](#), Red Teaming does not only focus on the technology but focuses on also people and processes in the simulated attacks.  

There are 3 types of Red Team attacks:
- Cyber (Digital Attacks includes Web, Network, Cloud, etc)
- Social Attacks (Exploiting people's behaviour)
- Physical (Attacks involving physical man-power)

Red Team attacks are similar to attacks used by real threat actors.
- Red Team Emulation - Copy attack techniques of threat actors
- Red Team Simulation - Mimics behaviour of threat actors

Red Teams try to compromise systems and get access to sensitive information in any way possible as quietly as possible leaving no footprints behind. 

### Penetration Testing vs Red Teaming


|             | Penetration Testing                                                             | Red Teaming                                                                                                                                                                    |

|             | Used to identify risks associated with exploitation of a target environment.    | Process of using real-world TTPs employed by threat-actors having goals to measure the effectiveness of the people, technologies and procedures used to defend an environment. |
|             | More emphasis on reducing exposed vulnerabilities.                              | More emphasis on Training and measuring risks and defence capabilities of an organization.                                                                                     |
|     | Limited                                                                         | Specific part of (or the entire) organization                                                                                                                                  |
| | Make assumptions about the environment, may not test where it isn't told to go. | Makes no assumptions attempts to compromise everywhere; pivots and changes strategy, techniques if/when needed.                                                                |
|             | Uses Tools present at that time during testing                                  | Constantly researching new exploits, vulnerabilities and implement attack with new tools as soon as discovered                                                                 |



## Benefits of Red Teaming

Red Teaming exercises help organizations get an threat actor's perspective on their systems and test Blue Team to see how they would withstand a real world cyberattack. Provides an understanding of blue team's capability to impact a threat's ability to operate.
