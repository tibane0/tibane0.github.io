## Merge Sort

This is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array by first breaking it down into smaller arrays, and then building the array back together the correct so that it is sorted.

### Step-by-step

1. Divide the unsorted array into two sub-arrays, half the size of the original.
2. Continue to divide the sub-arrays as long as the current piece of the array has more than one element.
3. Merge two sub-arrays together by always putting the lowest value first.
4. Keep merging until there are no sub-arrays left.

## Bubble Sort

This algorithms sorts an array from the lowest value to the highest value.

### Step-by-step

1. Go through the array, one value at a time.
2. For each value, compare the value with the next value
3. If the value is higher than the next one, swap the values so that the highest value comes last.
4. Go through the array as many times as there are values in the array.
