Searching algorithms are used to locate specific items within a collection of data. 

Two most common searching algorithms. 
1. Linear Search: It is used for an unsorted array. It mainly does one by one comparison of the item to be search with array element. it take O(n) Time
2. Binary Search: It is used for a sorted array. It mainly compares the array's middle element first and if the middle is same has input, then it returns, otherwise, it searches in either the left or right half based on comparison result. It takes O(log n) time.
