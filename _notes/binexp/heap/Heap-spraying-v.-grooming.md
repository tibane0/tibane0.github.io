# Heap spraying V. Heap grooming


## Heap Spraying

Heap spraying is the act of intentionally filling the target process's heap space with data using external attack primitive. A heap spray does not actually exploit any security issues but it makes a vulnerability easier to exploit. 

## Heap Grooming
A technique that attempts to shape the heap in a manner that allows for follow on exploitation by the attacker. This technique is pivotal to improving the reliability of using heap memory corruption for exploitation.
