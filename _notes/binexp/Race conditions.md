## TOCTOU Vulnerability

TOCTOU (Time of check / Time of use) is a class of software bugs caused by race conditions involving the checking of the state of a part of a system and the use of the results of that check.

TOCTOU race conditions are common in Unix between operations on the file system but can occur in other contexts, including local sockets and improper use of database transactions.
